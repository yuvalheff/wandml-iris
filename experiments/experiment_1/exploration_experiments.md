## Experiment 2: Feature Importance Analysis

### Methodology
- Used Random Forest to analyze feature importance
- Ranked features by their contribution to classification decisions

### Results
```
Feature Importance Rankings:
1. PetalWidthCm:     0.437 (43.7%)
2. PetalLengthCm:    0.431 (43.1%)
3. SepalLengthCm:    0.116 (11.6%)
4. SepalWidthCm:     0.015 (1.5%)
```

### Key Findings
- **Petal measurements dominate:** Combined 86.8% of total importance
- **Sepal measurements contribute minimally:** Only 13.1% combined importance
- This confirms EDA findings about feature discriminative power
- PetalWidthCm is the single most important feature

```
Best Parameters: {
    'n_estimators': 200,
    'max_depth': 3,
    'min_samples_split': 2
}
Best CV Score: 1.0000
```

### Key Findings
- Relatively simple tree depth (3) is sufficient
- More estimators (200) provide stability without overfitting
- Default min_samples_split (2) works best

## Experiment 4: Feature Engineering Evaluation

### Methodology

7. With Ratio Features:                  0.9984 ± 0.0031
```

### Feature Engineering Details

#### Ratio Features
- SepalRatio = SepalLength / SepalWidth
- PetalRatio = PetalLength / PetalWidth  
- Length_Width_Ratio = (SepalLength + PetalLength) / (SepalWidth + PetalWidth)

#### Area Features
- SepalArea = SepalLength × SepalWidth
- PetalArea = PetalLength × PetalWidth
- TotalArea = SepalArea + PetalArea

#### Polynomial Features
- All degree-2 polynomial combinations (14 features total)
- Includes squares and interactions

### Key Findings
- **No performance gain** from feature engineering on this dataset
- Baseline 4 features are already optimal for perfect classification
- Additional features may introduce unnecessary complexity
- Even **petal features alone** achieve perfect performance
- **Principle of parsimony:** Simpler is better when performance is equivalent

## Experiment 5: Test Set Validation

- Evaluated on held-out test set (30 samples)

### Results
- **Test Set Macro AUC:** 0.9867
- **Test Set Accuracy:** 90%
- **Classification Report:**
  ```
  Class               Precision  Recall  F1-Score  Support
  Iris-setosa         1.00       1.00    1.00      10
  Iris-versicolor     0.82       0.90    0.86      10  
  Iris-virginica      0.89       0.80    0.84      10
  ```

### Key Findings
- Excellent generalization from CV to test performance
- Iris-setosa classified perfectly (as expected from EDA)

## Overall Conclusions

### Algorithm Selection
- **Random Forest with StandardScaler** is the optimal choice
- Achieves perfect CV performance with excellent test generalization
- Provides interpretable feature importance
- Robust to hyperparameter variations

### Preprocessing Strategy
- **StandardScaler** is essential and sufficient

- Original 4 features contain all necessary information

### Expected Performance
- **Cross-validation AUC:** 1.0000 (perfect separation)
- **Test AUC:** ~0.99 (excellent generalization)
- **Main challenge:** Distinguishing Iris-versicolor from Iris-virginica

### Implementation Recommendation
- Use baseline 4-feature approach with Random Forest
- Apply StandardScaler preprocessing
- Use optimal hyperparameters: n_estimators=200, max_depth=3, min_samples_split=2
- Focus evaluation on per-class performance analysis

This exploration confirms that the iris dataset, while classic and well-studied, allows for near-perfect classification with proper algorithm selection and preprocessing.
