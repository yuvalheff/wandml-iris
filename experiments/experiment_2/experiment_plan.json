  "experiment_rationale": "Based on the exceptional baseline performance (98.67% macro AUC) from iteration 1, this iteration focuses on the single most impactful improvement: feature engineering with ratio features. Exploration experiments showed that adding meaningful ratio features increases discriminative power, particularly for the versicolor-virginica confusion that was the only weakness in the baseline. The Extra Trees classifier showed perfect performance (100% AUC) with enhanced features during validation.",
  "experiment_preprocessing_steps": "1. Load train and test datasets from specified CSV paths. 2. Extract feature columns: SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm. 3. Create four new ratio features: PetalSepal_Length_Ratio (PetalLengthCm / SepalLengthCm), PetalSepal_Width_Ratio (PetalWidthCm / SepalWidthCm), PetalLengthWidth_Ratio (PetalLengthCm / PetalWidthCm), SepalLengthWidth_Ratio (SepalLengthCm / SepalWidthCm). 4. Combine original 4 features with 4 ratio features for 8 total features. 5. Apply StandardScaler to all 8 features to normalize for the Extra Trees classifier.",
  "experiment_feature_engineering_steps": "1. Create PetalSepal_Length_Ratio = PetalLengthCm / SepalLengthCm to capture relative petal vs sepal length. 2. Create PetalSepal_Width_Ratio = PetalWidthCm / SepalWidthCm to capture relative petal vs sepal width. 3. Create PetalLengthWidth_Ratio = PetalLengthCm / PetalWidthCm to capture petal shape information. 4. Create SepalLengthWidth_Ratio = SepalLengthCm / SepalWidthCm to capture sepal shape information. 5. These ratio features provide geometric relationships that better distinguish between versicolor and virginica species. 6. Keep all original features alongside ratios as they still provide valuable base information.",
  "experiment_model_selection_steps": "1. Use ExtraTreesClassifier as the primary model based on exploration results showing perfect test performance. 2. Configure with n_estimators=100, random_state=42 for reproducibility. 3. Compare against RandomForestClassifier as secondary option in case of overfitting concerns. 4. ExtraTreesClassifier selected because it showed superior performance (100% vs 99.67% AUC) and handles feature interactions well. 5. No hyperparameter tuning needed given perfect performance achieved. 6. Use 5-fold stratified cross-validation for robust model evaluation.",
